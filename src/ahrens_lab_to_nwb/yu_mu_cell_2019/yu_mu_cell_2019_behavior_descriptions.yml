  series_name: FrameCaptureTTLSignal
  series_description: >
    Raw synchronization signal detecting shutter activation for the optical physiology camera.
    Forms the basis of the timestamps for the TwoPhotonSeries and corresponding Fluorescence.
    Values of the TTL signal significantly above 3.5 indicate start of volume scan;
    values significantly close to 3.5 indicate the scan of a single plane.

  series_name: SwimSignals
  series_description: >
    Raw ephys signals from electrodes attached to the tail of the paralyzed subject.
    Tracks 'effective' motor output of subject for use in virtual reality environment.
    This is later classified to define the state intervals (Active vs. Passive)
    and trials (closed-loop or open-loop)
- matlab_key: stimVelTotal
  series_name: TotalStimulusVelocitySignal
  series_description: Raw signal calculating (drift speed - motosensory gain) x swim power.
- matlab_key: stimVelNull
  series_name: BaselineStimulusVelocitySignal
  series_description: Raw signal for drift speed of visual grating presented to the subject.
- matlab_key: stimGain
  series_name: StimulusGainSignal
  series_description: Raw signal tracking the gain of the visual stimulus.
- matlab_key: stimID
  series_name: StimulusTypeSignal
  series_description: >
    Raw signal tracking the type of the presented visual stimulus. Most of the time this will likely just be a binary
    signal for tracking the on/off status.

    - stimParam3
    - stimParam4
    - stimParam5
  series_name: StimulusParameterSignals
  series_description: A collection of raw stimulus parameter signals.
